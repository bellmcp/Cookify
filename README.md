# What I Learned

* Learn how to organize and structure by using modules and functions, how to create data privacy and encapsulation.
* Asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX calls and APIs.
* Modern JavaScript: Learn how to set up a modern development workflow with NPM, Webpack, Babel and ES6 modules.
* Implementing MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture: `SEARCH CONTROLLER`, `RECIPE CONTROLLER`, `LIKE CONTROLLER` & `LIST CONTROLLER`.

# Future Ideas Include

* Implement button to delete all shopping list items.
* Implement functionality to manually add items to shopping list.
* Save shopping list data in local storage.
* Improve error handling.
